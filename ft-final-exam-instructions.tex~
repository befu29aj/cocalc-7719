\textbf{Final Exam Instructions}

Here are the types of questions you can expect for the final exam.

\begin{itemize}
\item Solve any of the following equations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item linear (or systems of linear equations)
  \item quadratic
  \item exponential
  \item logarithmic
  \item trigonometric
  \end{itemize}
\item Calculate slopes and $y$-intercepts of linear equations. Draw
  diagrams of linear equations.
\item Solve any plane or spherical triangle.
\item Simplify algebraic expressions, especially radicals, exponents,
  logarithms, and using factoring. Algebraic expressions are
  expressions containing variables such as $x,y$, etc.
\item Identify conic sections and calculate their features from a
  given equation.
\item Use vectors to find bearings/angles and lengths in coordinate
  systems or for force problems.
\item Solve word problems involving the normal distribution or the
  approximation of the binomial distribution by the normal
  distribution.
\item Solve word problems using any of the methods in this list.
\end{itemize}

Here are some exam instructions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item You are allowed to use any hand-held calculator you want. No
  devices that are not primarily used as calculators are permitted
  (such as a smartphone).
\item You may compose your own formula sheet. It must be 8 1/2 by 11
  and be hand-written. You may write on the back and the front.
\item You must show your work. Results without work leading to those
  results do not earn points.
\end{enumerate}

Here are some problems to practice for the final exam not covered in
the term tests.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 39.5\% of Canadians voted for the Liberals in the last election.
  Approximate the probability that a random sample of 50 Canadians
  contains 18--22 people who voted for the Liberals?
\item The amount of sugar in a 10kg bag is normally distributed. The
  mean is $\mu=10.09$kg; the standard deviation is $\sigma=0.045$kg.
  What percentage of 10kg bags contains less than 10kg?
\item Warranty issues for a refrigerator arise after a certain number
  of days which is normally distributed. The mean is $\mu=432$ days;
  the standard deviation is $\sigma=47$ days. If the warranty covers
  the cost of a repair within $365$ days, what is the percentage of
  warranty issues that the company providing the warranty has to
  cover?
\item How many people with an IQ of over 140 would you expect to live
  in Canada? Use a normal distribution with mean $\mu=100$, standard
  deviation $\sigma=15$, and 36.3 million for Canada's population.
\item Santiago in Chile (longitude $70^{\circ}$W) and Sydney in
  Australia (longitude $151^{\circ}$E) both have a latitude of
  $33^{\circ}$S. How far apart are they along a great circle? Use
  Napier's miraculous pentagram.
\item Santa lives near Resolute Bay in Nunavut at $74^{\circ}42'$N,
  $94^{\circ}50'$W. His reindeer go to London, England, roughly
  south-east, covering a distance of 4687km. Santa goes roughly
  south-west at an exact right angle to where the reindeer went. He
  covers a distance of 3000km. How far is he from London?
\item Solve the following right spherical triangles for the side or
  angle specified. $C$ is the right angle.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $a=16^{\circ}13',b=59^{\circ}7'$ find angle $A$
  \item $c=107^{\circ}13',A=63^{\circ}14'$ find side $b$
  \item $A=135^{\circ}27'15'',B=82^{\circ}21'30''$ find side $a$
  \item $b=0.7089,B=1.1781$ find angle $A$
  \end{enumerate}
\item Find the shortest distance between the following cities along
  the great circle.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Vancouver ($49^{\circ}15'$N, $123^{\circ}6'$W) and Taipei City
    ($25^{\circ}2'$N, $121^{\circ}38'$E)
  \item Vancouver ($49^{\circ}15'$N, $123^{\circ}6'$W) and Rio de
    Janeiro ($22^{\circ}54'$S, $43^{\circ}12'$W)
  \item Lom{\'e} ($6^{\circ}8'$N, $1^{\circ}13'$E) and Hanoi
    ($21^{\circ}2'$N, $105^{\circ}51'$E)
  \end{enumerate}
\item Find the distance, the initial course, and the final course in
  traveling from the first city listed in each problem below to the
  second.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item San Francisco ($37^{\circ}47'$N, $122^{\circ}26'$W) and
    Honolulu ($21^{\circ}18'$N, $157^{\circ}52'$W)
  \item Melbourne ($37^{\circ}50'$S, $144^{\circ}59'$E) and Quito
    ($0^{\circ}14'$S, $78^{\circ}30'$W)
  \item Moscow ($55^{\circ}45'$N, $37^{\circ}34'$E) and New York
    ($40^{\circ}49'$N, $73^{\circ}57'$W)
  \end{enumerate}
\item Solve the following spherical triangles.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $a=38^{\circ},b=45^{\circ},B=65^{\circ}$
  \item $B=110^{\circ}10',C=132^{\circ}59',b=146^{\circ}6'$
  \item $a=\frac{13\pi}{36},b=\frac{7\pi}{9},c=\frac{11\pi}{18}$
  \item $A=126^{\circ}14',B=115^{\circ}37',c=43^{\circ}15'$
  \item $A=128^{\circ}19',B=112^{\circ}13',C=78^{\circ}14'$
  \end{enumerate}
\item The spherical triangle lies on the sphere with radius $R$. Find
  the length of $a$, not represented as an angle.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $A=60^{\circ},B=70^{\circ},C=100^{\circ},R=90$
  \item $A=31^{\circ}5',b=78^{\circ}10',c=91^{\circ}7',R=24.2$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
