\textbf{Term Test A Instructions}

Some rules for the term test:
\begin{itemize}
\item I will probably reseat you in random order.
\item You are only allowed to leave the classroom (for example, to go
  to the bathroom) if no one else has left the classroom. Ask for
  permission to leave. 
\item You are not allowed to submit your test to the instructor and
  leave the classroom for the first 45 minutes.
\item All electronic devices must be turned off except for a
  calculator that cannot perform matrix arithmetic.
\item If you commit an act of academic dishonesty, I will take your
  case to the dean.
\item You are graded on the steps that lead to your results. Correct
  results with incorrect or missing work to get to the results do not
  earn points.
\end{itemize}

Here is the material covered for term test A:
\begin{description}
\item[Matrix Arithmetic] addition, multiplication, inverse, transpose,
  adjugate, determinant, areas of triangles and parallelograms.
\item[Systems of Linear Equations] curve fitting, word problems,
  echelon form.
\item[Complex Arithmetic] addition, multiplication, division,
  exponents, radicals, polar and rectangular form, solving complex
  equations.
\end{description}

I have posted lab questions and solutions on D2L for additional term
test practice.
