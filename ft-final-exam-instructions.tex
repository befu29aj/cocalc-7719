\textbf{Final Exam Instructions}

Here are the types of questions you can expect for the final exam.

\begin{itemize}
\item Solve any of the following equations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item linear
  \item quadratic
  \item exponential
  \item logarithmic
  \end{itemize}
\item Solve mixture problems.
\item Simplify algebraic expressions, especially radicals, exponents,
  and logarithms. Algebraic expressions are expressions containing
  variables such as $x,y$, etc.
\item Solve problems involving interest rates, exponential growth,
  exponential decay, or Newton's Cooling Law.
\item Differentiate functions and find line equations for tangent
  lines of a function at a point.
\item Analyze functions (required features will be listed in the
  question).
\item Use Newton's method to find the $x$-intercept(s) of a function.
\item Find definite and indefinite integrals and areas under a curve.
\item Solve word problems using any of the methods in this list.
\end{itemize}

Here are some exam instructions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item You are allowed to use any hand-held calculator you want. No
  devices that are not primarily used as calculators are permitted
