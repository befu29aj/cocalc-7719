  \frametitle{Percent}
The definition of percent is similar to the definition of the word
``quarter.'' When I say, ``three quarters,'' I mean $\frac{3}{4}$.
When I say ``sixty-two percent,'' I mean $\frac{62}{100}$. Percent is
not a unit---it simply means that the number in question is divided by
one hundred. Have a look at the following table.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Percent}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}\hline
  $0.12$ & 12\% \\ \hline
  three quarters & 75\% \\ \hline
  $0.75$ & 75\% \\ \hline
  one half & 50\% \\ \hline
  $0.5$ & 50\% \\ \hline
  one and a half & 150\% \\ \hline
  $1.3$ & 130\% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Mixtures}
  You need a 15\% acid solution for a certain test, but your supplier
  only ships a 10\% solution and a 30\% solution. Rather than pay the
  hefty surcharge to have the supplier make a 15\% solution, you
  decide to mix 10\% solution with 30\% solution, to make your own
  15\% solution. You need 10 liters of the 15\% acid solution. How
  many liters of 10\% solution and 30\% solution should you use?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Mixtures}
  Let $x$ stand for the number of liters of 10\% solution, and let $y$
  stand for the number of liters of 30\% solution. For mixture
  problems, it is often helpful to create a table:

  \bigskip

  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}\hline
    & liters solution & percent acid & total liters acid \\ \hline
    10\% solution & $x$ & 0.10 & $0.10x$ \\ \hline
    30\% solution & $y$ & 0.30 & $0.30y$ \\ \hline
    mixture & $x+y=10$ & 0.15 & $0.15\cdot{}10=1.5$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Mixtures}
  Since $x+y=10$, then $x=10â€“y$. Using this, we can substitute for $x$
  in our grid, and eliminate one of the variables:

  \bigskip

  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}\hline
    & liters solution & percent acid & total liters acid \\ \hline
    10\% solution & $10-y$ & 0.10 & $0.10\cdot(10-y)$ \\ \hline
    30\% solution & $y$ & 0.30 & $0.30y$ \\ \hline
    mixture & $x+y=10$ & 0.15 & $0.15\cdot{}10=1.5$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Mixtures}
  When the problem is set up like this, you can usually use the last
  column to write your equation. The liters of acid from the 10\%
  solution, plus the liters of acid in the 30\% solution, add up to
  the liters of acid in the 15\% solution. Then:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:voocoshi}
    \begin{array}{rcl}
      0.10\cdot(10-y)+0.30y&=&1.5 \\
      1-0.10y+0.30y&=&1.5 \\
      1+0.20y&=&1.5 \\
      0.20y&=&0.5 \\
      y&=&2.5
    \end{array}
  \end{equation}
  Then we need 2.5 liters of the 30\% solution, and
  $x=10-y=10-2.5=7.5$ liters of the 10\% solution. If you think about
  it, this makes sense. Fifteen percent is closer to 10\% than to
  30\%, so we ought to need more 10\% solution in our mix.

  \frametitle{Exercises}
  {\ubung} Your school is holding an event this weekend. Students have
  been pre-selling tickets to the event; adult tickets are \$5.00, and
  child tickets (for kids six years old and under) are \$2.50. From
  past experience, you expect about 13,000 people to attend the event.

  This is the first year in which tickets prices have been reduced for
  the younger children, so you really don't know how many child
  tickets and how many adult tickets you can expect to sell. You
  decide to use the information from the pre-sold tickets to estimate
  the ratio of adults to children, and estimate the expected revenue
  from this information.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Exercises}
  You consult with your student ticket-sellers and discover that they
  have not been keeping track of how many child tickets they have
  sold. The tickets are identical, until the ticket-seller punches a
  hole in the ticket, indicating that it is a child ticket. They don't
  remember how many holes they have punched. They only know that they
  have sold 548 tickets for \$2460. How much revenue from each of
  child and adult tickets can you expect?
